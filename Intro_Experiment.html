        You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you
        decide whether or not to participate it is important that you understand
        why the research is being done, what it will involve and how the
        information collected from you is stored and used. You may contact us
        via email (<a href="mailto:anna.bevan@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk"
          >anna.bevan@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk</a
        >) or a Prolific message to the researcher if there is anything that is
        not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide
        whether or not you wish to take part.
      </p>
      <strong>What is the purpose of the study?</strong>
      <p>
        We are interested in how people make decisions about foraging, exploring and resting in different kinds of environment, and about how such decision-making might relate to mood. We have developed an
        online task which is designed to examine these questions. 
      </p>

      <strong>Who is organising and sponsoring this research?</strong>
      <p>
        Cambridge University is the sponsor for this study. We will be using
        information from you in order to undertake this study and will act as
        the data controller for this. Your rights to access, change or move your
        information are limited, as we need to manage your information in
        specific ways in order for the research to be reliable and accurate. If
        you withdraw from the study, we will destroy any data about you that we
        have already obtained. To safeguard your rights, we will use the minimum
        personally-identifiable information possible. You can find out more
        about how we use your information at:

      <strong>Has the study been reviewed?</strong>
      <p>
        This study has been reviewed by an independent group of people
        (Cambridge Psychology Research Ethics Committee) who have a duty to
        protect research volunteers' safety, rights, wellbeing and dignity.
      </p>
      <strong> Why have I been invited to take part? </strong>
      <p>
        You have been invited to participate because you are registered with
        Prolific Academic and you meet the eligibility criteria.
      </p>

      <strong>Do I have to take part?</strong>
      <p>
        It is up to you whether or not you decide to take part. Before deciding
        you should read this information sheet and ask about anything that is
        not clear. If you decide to take part we will ask you to fill in a form
        indicating that you have agreed (consent form). However, even after you
        have completed that form you can withdraw from the study without having to
        give us a reason.
      </p>

      <strong>What will I be asked to do in the study? </strong>
      <p>
        If you decide to take part, we will ask you to complete an online
        experimental task measuring resource conservation and foraging. We will
        ask you to use the arrow keys on the computer keyboard to search for
        "energy points" in a series of environments pictured on the computer
        screen. Your task will be to collect as many points as possible while
        limiting how far you have to go to find them. We will also ask you to
        fill out some questionnaires about various aspects of your mood and
        report on previous mental health diagnoses you might have received.
      </p>

      <strong>How long will it take? </strong>
      <p>
        We expect the session to take up to 45 minutes, including plenty
        of time to allow for rests between tasks.
      </p>

      <strong>Will I find the study upsetting? </strong>
      <p>
        Some of the questionnaire items will ask you about symptoms of low
        mood and anxiety, including any past episodes of depression or times
        when you have been very anxious. If thinking or talking about these
        topics causes you to feel any distress, there is no need to continue with the study. 
        We have provided information about relevant services and helplines at the bottom of this page.
      </p>

      <strong>Can I withdraw from the study? </strong>
      <p>
        You may withdraw from the study at any time, without explaining why. You can withdraw by pressing
        the <b>"Cancel"</b> button during the session. However, once you have completed the experiment, your data will not be able to be deleted since we would be unable to identify which data belongs to you.
      </p>

      <strong>Will I be paid for taking part?</strong>
      <p>
        To thank you for your contribution to this study we will give you £8 for
        each hour of your time.
      </p>
      <strong>Will I be given feedback about my data?</strong>
      <p>
        We will not be able to provide any specific feedback about your data
        from the foraging task because we will be analysing this data at a group
        level only. We will also not be making any diagnoses on the basis of the
        interview or questionnaires about your mood. </p>

      <strong>What are the possible risks/side effects of taking part? </strong>
      <p>
        There are no obvious risks from the foraging task that you will be asked
        to complete. If you become tired or uncomfortable during the task you
        can pause or withdraw the study at your own discretion. Remember you can
        withdraw from the study at any time without needing to give us a reason.
      </p>
      <strong>What data will be collected? </strong>
      <p>
        You will provide us with research data. It will include information like
        the buttons you pushed on a computer task and your answers on a
        questionnaire; in other words, information from which it would not be
        possible, or would be very difficult, to identify you personally.
      </p>

      <strong>What about browser cookies? </strong>

      <p>
        This study uses cookies - small packets of information sent by our
        server and stored by your web browser. Some of these will be deleted
        automatically when you close your browser, others will remain after you
        close your browser. These persistent cookies can be removed manually
        using your browser settings. Cookies are necessary in order for the
        experiment to run properly and will not contain any sensitive or
        personal information. By taking part you agree to the use of cookies.

      <strong>What happens to my data? </strong>

      <p>
        Your research data, typically combined with similar information from
        other volunteers, will be used for scientific purposes. The results are
        typically presented in scientific papers and talks, in teaching and in
        explaining our science to health professionals, school groups and the
        public in general. We take great care to ensure that individuals cannot
        be identified from our research outputs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Undertaking scientific studies is expensive and relies on the generous
        contribution of time from volunteers. To make the most of your research
        data, we plan to look after it for the long term and may use it to
        answer research questions beyond those for which it was originally
        collected. This may include combining research data from this study with
        research data from other studies in the CBU in which you have been
        involved. In addition to our own analyses, we agree with the principle
        that research data, often collected with public money, are a public
        good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly
        available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and
        responsible manner. Many of the bodies that fund our research insist
        that we follow this principle. In line with this, we may also share
        research data with other researchers in the UK and around the world,
        free of charge. This is important for the scientific process, so that
        other researchers have the opportunity to check our results, or conduct
        new analyses. It also helps avoid research duplication.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are aware that, very rarely, research data could be used to identify
        an individual (for example, questionnaire responses about life events
        could identify a particular person to someone who knows him or her). In
        such cases, we take great care to reduce the chances of such
        identification by omitting critical details. Moreover, in most cases, we
        will require people who access research data to agree to a "data usage
        agreement", where they agree not to try to identify anyone, and not
        share the data will anyone else. However, on occasion, there is a need
        to make the data fully "open". If research data are made open, then we
        have no control over how that information is used.
      </p>

      <strong
        >You should only agree to participate in this study if you have
        understood and consent to this re-use and sharing of research data.
      </strong>
      <p>
        If you change your mind and later withdraw your consent to participate
        in this study (you can contact us via email
        <a href="mailto:anna.bevan@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk"
          >anna.bevan@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk</a
        >
        or a Prolific message), we will not collect any additional data about
        you. We will delete your data if you withdraw before the study was
        published or shared with others. However, any research data already
        published or shared with other investigators cannot be destroyed,
        withdrawn or recalled.
      </p>

      <strong>Can I get access to my results from the study? </strong>
      <p>
        It is important that, as researchers, we minimise potential worry to
        volunteers in our studies. We often use new techniques and interpreting
        research data can be complicated and has the potential to cause undue
        concern. For this reason we do not divulge individual scores. If you
        have concerns about your performance please discuss these with the
        researcher.
      </p>

      <strong
        >Are there compensation arrangements if something goes wrong?
      </strong>
      <p>
        Adequate provision is made for insurance or indemnity to cover
        liabilities which may arise in relation to the design, management and
        conduct of the research project.
      </p>

      <strong>What should I do if I have a complaint about the study? </strong>
      <p>
        We are keen that volunteers feel informed and well treated when they
        take part in our research. If you have a complaint about this study
        please contact the Principal Investigator listed at the end of this
        information sheet in the first instance. If you are not happy with the
        response, please contact the Director of the Cognition and Brain
        Sciences Unit (<a href="mailto:director@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk"
          >director@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk</a
        >). Further steps can be taken through the University of Cambridge if
        necessary.

      <p>
        Following this page, you will be asked to complete an experimental task.
        You will be shown a picture of a map with different elements such as
        trees, mountains, and rivers — like the image below:
      </p>
      <img
        src="img/demo_summer.png"
        style="width: 950px; display: block; margin: 50px auto"
        alt="Example environment"
      />
      <p>
        Scattered throughout the map, there are hidden
        <b>"energy points"</b> that provide you energy when you touch them. Every time a new environment is generated, you will be asked to do a couple of things: First, you will be asked to rate your mood and energy at the moment. Then, you will be shown the environment for 2 seconds, and then asked to estimate how many energy points are available in the environment, and how certain you are in your prediction. Then, you will be given a choice to <b>"Forage"</b> or to <b>"Rest"</b>.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 50px">If you decide to forage, you will be able to move through the map using the arrow keys, and attain energy points. However, every time you take a step, you lose one energy point. As you spend and gain more energy points, a counter at the bottom of your screen will indicate how many points you have. You can explore for as long or as little as you like, as long as you have energy points available. Once you are done with exploring, you can press the <b>"F"</b> key to go ahead to the next environment.</p>

        <p style="margin: 50px 0px">If you choose to rest, you will be unable to move on the map for some time, and the next environment will be generated once your waiting time is done. However, during this time, you will gain a consistent amount of energy points.</p>

        <p style = "margin: 50px 0px">There are 18 environments in total, and breaks are allocated every 3 environments in case you need them. When you are done, you will be asked to complete some questionnaires. Once you feel like you understand the instructions, please click the button to start the task!</p>

        <p style = "margin: 50px 0px">This experiment was made to be done on computer, and can run on any major browser application. However, we recommend that you use either Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge for greater support. Depending on the size of your screen, the task elements may appear too large or too little. Therefore, when completing the experiment, please adjust your screen zoom using Ctrl +/- until all elements comfortably fit on your screen.</p>
